Redocs Mind Dump
================

Place to save crazy ideas for future of redocs and all related stuff.

- View component dependency tree
  - Is it possible to walk render paths to show component usage based off of props?!
- Click hotkey to open components from dev build
- Ensure Tota11ly is integrated for testing
- Integrate with https://spiritjs.io/
- Need to explore the "fixture manifest"" which gets default exported from fixture files
  - Eg. should this become more of a general-purpose "component manifest"
    - I lean towards not so to not pidgen-hole HOW to structure apps
- Check out Deco React-Native IDE
  - Nice property editing
  - Stubs props (we had similar ideas with generating fixtures)
